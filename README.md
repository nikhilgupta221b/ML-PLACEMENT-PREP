## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

## Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a task through experience. ML systems learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
